## Open A Trade

To open a trade a user can call the `openLong(uint256 _collateral, uint256 _leverage)` to open a long or `openShort(uint256 _collateral, uint256 _leverage)` to open a short. Two parameters are passed through.

1. How much collateral to deposit denominated in wei
2. What leverage the trader wants that is > 1 and <= 20

Both of these input parameters will create a position size.

- position size = collateral \* leverage

The Collateral + initFee (see Init Fee section) is how much the user pays.

The Position size is how much the user's trade size is and how much the contrat "annexes" off.

A Dynamic Funding rate will be applied. Read More about DFR here.

A new trade struct will be created

```
Storage.Trade(
            stableTokenCollateral,
            openPrice,
            long,
            userAddress,
            assetTokenBorrowed,
            stableTokenBorrowed,
            newShares
        );
```

- stableTokenCollateral --> User collateral -> uint256
- openPrice -> Price of Asset class at open --> uint256
- Long -> Is it a long --> bool
- UserAddress --> msg.sender --> Address
- assetTokenBorrowed --> 0 if short, if long position size --> uint256
- stableTokenBorrowed --> 0 if long if short position size --> uint256
- newShares --> see DFR --> uint256

To read this at any time call `tradeIdToTrade(uint256 _tradeId)`

Finally global variables are updated

- For Longs
  - assetTokenBorrowPool -> amount of asset borrrowed (add our user's position size)
  - stableTokenCollateralPool --> All collateral put up by users (add in the user's collateral)
- For Shorts
  - stableTokenBorrowPool -> amount of stable borrrowed (add our user's position size)
  - stableTokenCollateralPool --> All collateral put up by users (add in the user's collateral)
  - shortBorrowValue --> TODO

## Open Long Events

Logged Events

- `event LongOpened(address indexed provider, uint256 assetTokenAmount, uint256 tradeId, uint256 timestamp)`
  - Provider -> address that opened trade
  - assetTokenAmount -> The Position Size
  - tradeId -> Id of trade made
  - timestamp -> When the trade was made

## Open Short Events

- `event ShortOpened(address indexed provider, uint256 assetTokenAmount, uint256 tradeId, uint256 timestamp)`
  - Provider -> address that opened trade
  - assetTokenAmount -> The Position Size
  - tradeId -> Id of trade made
  - timestamp -> When the trade was made

## Initiation Fee

- Each trade requires an initiation fee to be made. These fees act as payment to the liquidity providers.
- The initFee is subject to change and is stored in
- The actual fee paid is initFee \* position size
- There is a discount applied for having FSTokens and can be found by quering `function getDiscountedInitFee()`. It will return a uint
