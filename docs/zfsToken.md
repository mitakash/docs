- The fs token is used in our system for voting and discounts.
- The code is OpenZeppelin's upgradability admin proxy and a snapshot token that is mintable. All transfer functions have been removed
- The proxy owner of the contract is the voting contract itself see voting.md
- The minter of the FsToken is the owner, and the incentives contract
