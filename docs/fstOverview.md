### Futureswap Token (FST)

Futureswap Token (FST) is earned by interacting with the platform. Traders, liquidity providers, and referrers all earn FST based on their weekly volumes. An example of how incentives are earned is, if a trader is 1% of the platform's trade volume, they will earn 1% of that week's trader rewards. FST is used as a discount token for cheaper trading commissions. The contracts give a discount for how many tokens the trader has in their wallet and are not burnt. The starting maximum discount is 30% of trade fees. FST goes beyond a discount token and is actually the governance token for all of Futureswap.
