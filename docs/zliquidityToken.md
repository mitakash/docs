- The liquidity token gets created by the factory and deployed by the liquidity token factory (see factory.md)
- It is essentially an OpenZeppelin snapshot token with minting and burning.
- The minter role is held only by the exchange
- The exchange can burn from without permission to avoid an extra transaction by user. This can only be called on remove liquidity. This is in ERC20.sol burnFrom function
- It also requires that the incentive contract is the only contract calling snapshot
