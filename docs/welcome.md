Futureswap is a protocol for perpetual futures trading on Ethereum.

Futureswap is a decentralized exchange that allows traders to enter into perpetual futures with up to 20x leverage while liquidity providers can earn fees and interest. The platform is governed by the community, which is powered by an underlying governance (FST) token that allows anyone to propose new exchanges or changes in the system.

Our goal was to take the best parts of centralized exchanges and the necessary parts of decentralized governance to merge it into a system that is self-governed and aligned on a common goal.

Key advantages of Futureswap:

1. Easily add pairs
1. 20x leverage
1. No slippage
1. LP returns
1. Community governed (pairs, fees, leverage cap, liquidation reward, and more).
1. Futureswap Token (FST)
